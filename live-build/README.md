gcodis distro compilations
==========================

We base our compilations in the `live-build` Debian GNU/Linux system build tool.

Here there are different distro compilations, prepared to build an ISO-Hybridi, .IMG and LXC local containers.

chdir into each one of the directories and do `lb build` to begin and generate that compilation.
